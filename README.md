Hello, this is the website I've made using React.

These are the things:

1. 99% similarity to mockup
2. Basic animations
3. Add/delete functionality on employees list.
4. Carousel on testimonial.
5. Responsive design up to mobile view.
6. Implemented Google Maps(But I did not put in the API key)
7. Applied basic Navigation.
8. I've also hosted this website temporarily on Firebase. (https://personal-13123.web.app)

I mostly use only React hooks in this project, and I do not see any reason to use Redux as this is not a big project.
